# Custom LSP Markdown Syntax

This is an attempt to improve the look of LSP popups. It's [lsp\_markdown.vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/08f81f0f29ce7415e79cae214c326a347171ab11/runtime/syntax/lsp_markdown.vim) sourcing [mkdc.vim](https://github.com/prurigro/vim-markdown-concealed/blob/401f9d729274f87168bf126b9c477c721ce1711a/syntax/mkdc.vim) instead of [markdown.vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/634315c6f7464c2b1a3fca71ec68de09c4d89d8e/runtime/syntax/markdown.vim). In most cases, I think it looks pretty good. In cases like [Alternative.md](Alternative.md), it doesn't.
