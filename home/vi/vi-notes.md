# vi Notes

## Things that maybe me or maybe someone else will look into some day

- [Is it possible to improve LSP hover look?](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/tx40m2/is_it_possible_to_improve_lsp_hover_look/)

## Things that are already documented but that I'm afraid I'll forget

- `gx` will open up a link at the cursor in a browser.
- `<C-w>w` will focus the next window (e.g. a popup).
