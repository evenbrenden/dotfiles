## Things that maybe me or maybe someone else will look into some day

- [neovim lsp diagnostic get_count deprecated but unused](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70541287/neovim-lsp-diagnostic-get-count-deprecated-but-unused)
- [LSP hover does not conceal backticks in title](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16114)

## Things that are probably documented but that I'm afraid I'll forget

- `gx` will open up a link at the cursor in your browser.
- Calling an LSP popup command twice focuses that popup.
